# 0x04. Files manager

File managers are an essential part of modern operating systems, including Windows Explorer (Windows), Finder (macOS), and various file managers in the Linux/Unix world (e.g., Nautilus, Dolphin, and Thunar).

A cloud file manager, often referred to as a cloud-based file manager or cloud file explorer, is a web application or software tool that allows users to manage files and folders stored in cloud storage services. These services provide a convenient way to store, organize, and access files and data over the internet, typically using remote servers hosted by cloud service providers.
